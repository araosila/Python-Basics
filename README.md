Python Fundamentals & Mini-Projects

This repository contains my basic Python exercises and mini-projects created while learning the fundamentals of the language.

These projects cover basic concepts such as:
* Variables and Data Types
* Conditional Statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`)
* Loops (`while`/`for`)
* Functions
* Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with `class`
* Simple GUI development with `Tkinter`
